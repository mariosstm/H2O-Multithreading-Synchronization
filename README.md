# H2O-Multithreading-Synchronization
## In Java
There are given 3 threads that have to be synchronized , with the sole purpose of creating H2O molecules.
* Thread-1: produces a Hydrogen atom
* Thread-2: produces an Oxygen atom  
* Thread-3: produces a Water Molecule

We have to synchronize these 3 threads and when 100 molecules of water are formed, 
the program can exit.
