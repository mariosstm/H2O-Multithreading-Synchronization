## H2O-Multithreading-Synchronization
# In Java
There are given 3 threads that have to be synchronized , with the sole purpose of creating H2O molecules.
One produces a Hydrogen atom, one produces an Oxygen atom and the third one produces a Water Molecule.
We have to synchronize these 3 threads and when 100 molecules of water are formed then the program can exit.
